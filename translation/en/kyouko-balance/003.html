<p>25 years old. Detective.</p>
<p>The head of a detective agency.</p>
<p>The forgetful and the fastest, whose memories reset every day.</p>
<p>She asked me what this place is even though I don&#x27;t know how to read the name of it. For the time being, let&#x27;s just say that there is only one possibility, that is &quot;Namishiro Park&quot;. She seems to enjoy sleeping on benches. On her left arm was written some of her personal information, you can hardly see it.</p>
<p>Somehow, when she finished observing me, a not-suspicious guy, she lowered her head and woke up. She then rolled up her sleeves, took a memo from under the left sleeve of her sweater and started reading it. I happened to notice her really slender arms when she rolled up her sleeves. She was preparing to introduce herself.</p>
<p>She also keeps a memorandum in which she writes things in case she forgot something.</p>
<p>Like a middle schooler.</p>
<p>On her right arm was another message saying &quot;You are in the middle of a case&quot;.</p>
<p>She also had some messages on both her left and right hands.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s kind of attractive.</p>
<p>&quot;I see. Anyway, I was visiting this city for a case and it seems I carelessly fell asleep during the investigation.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, she fell asleep in the middle of an investigation.</p>
<p>This also means that she forgot everything she had found.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#x27;s a pretty beautiful city but I don&#x27;t know how I came here. Is there something interesting in the neighborhood, Araragi-kun?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Something interesting?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yes, do you know of any strange things happening in this city recently?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>
<p>To be honest, I only know about strange things. It seems that only strange things are happening in this city. But there&#x27;s no way I can be honest and tell her the truth.</p>
<p>&quot;No, there&#x27;s nothing that comes to my mind right now. There are no criminals nor lolicons in this city.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I didn&#x27;t ask about the latter though.&quot;</p>
<p>By the way, touching the hair of a girl without her permission is not illegal, right?</p>
<p>She would reprove it if I told her that.</p>
<p>It must be some kind of cultural difference, something that depends on where you live.</p>
<p>&quot;If there&#x27;s nothing in this town, maybe I should broaden my search.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Well, there aren&#x27;t a lot of cities close by. Are you looking for things like traffic accidents, robberies in museums or arsons? I have the feeling I saw something like that in a newspaper.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I see.&quot;</p>
<p>She looked satisfied with my vague information. Kyouko-san then rolled up the cuff of her long skirt. I stared at her, unconsciously.</p>
<p>&quot;Unconsciously? You&#x27;re supposed to avert your eyes in this situation.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oops. I&#x27;m sorry. It&#x27;s a cultural difference.&quot;</p>
<p>I looked at the sky.</p>
<p>The weather was starting to clear up.</p>
<p>It seems that Kyouko-san was looking for other hints and was searching for memos that she may have left on her body. Does she wear a long skirt to hide memos written on her legs?</p>
<p>When I was peeping under her skirt, I saw that she really had beautiful legs. And I mean it with <a href="#" title="TL note 3: In Japanese, å¥‡éº— (kirei, &#x27;beautiful&#x27;) can also mean &#x27;clean&#x27; or &#x27;pure&#x27;.">the three meanings of beautiful.</a></p>
<p>In the end, she didn&#x27;t find other memos. &quot;Araragi-kun, can you come over here?&quot;, she said, straightening up and putting back her skirt in its original state.</p>
<p>&quot;Well, that&#x27;s a problem. What kind of investigation was I in the middle of? It&#x27;s impossible for me to be this negligent. I should have prepared something.&quot;</p>
<p>She really is confident.</p>
<p>The kind of confidence that I didn&#x27;t have in my whole life.</p>
<p>&quot;Maybe there is a clue in your cellphone?&quot;</p>
<p>This is the kind of question the assistant of an amateur detective would ask. In reality, it&#x27;s more the kind of stupid question that even the most stupid person would not think about. The forgetful detective has a very strict confidentiality duty. That is why she doesn&#x27;t have any traces of job-related cases in her belongings.</p>
<p>Memos written on her body must be one of those rare cases of emergency. By the way, Kyouko-san doesn&#x27;t have a cellphone, not even a handbag.</p>
<p>In other words, she was completely at a loss.</p>
<p>&quot;Araragi-kun. I know that it&#x27;s not the kind of thing I should ask someone I just recently met, but would you hear my request?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;As long as your request is not asking me to drink your blood, everything is OK.&quot;</p>
<p>Kyouko-san did not flinch at my masochistic joke. Could it also be one of those cultural differences? I&#x27;ll let it slide for now.</p>
<p>&quot;Would you mind looking at my back?&quot;</p>
<p>She then turned around to show me her back. She put her hands in the cuff of her skirt. I heard a sound coming from the middle of her sweater.</p>
<p>&quot;OK, I took off my underwear so please roll up my sweater and T- shirt. You have no choice but to look at my back to find some clues since I can&#x27;t do it by myself.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Eh? What did you just say? Please stop saying things like that. Removing the clothes of a woman I don&#x27;t know and checking her back is something I can&#x27;t do!&quot;</p>
<p>A third-year high schooler touching the hair of a sleeping girl and staring at her bare legs really questions the ethics of the said high- schooler. And obviously we could add helping a girl remove her clothes.</p>
<p>I have two little sisters, so I am accustomed to this kind of thing. Well, if her body is as beautiful as the peek I had suggested, then I&#x27;d prefer writing something on her back rather than looking at it.</p>
<p>We would need the help of a third person.</p>
<p>Conversely, if something was indeed written on her back, then it must be something really confidential to be hidden this well.</p>
<p>Directly on her spine.</p>
<p>A spine that is so wonderful and smooth that you would like to touch it.</p>
<p>I didn&#x27;t have the opportunity to touch the back of other people recently. The occasion of touching the back of such a beauty may be a once-in-a-lifetime thing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was as you can expect.</p>
<p>On the third vertebra.</p>
<p>A message.</p>
<p>It was clearly written by someone else since the writing was more disordered compared to the previous messages. And also because it&#x27;s impossible for her to write something in this particular location.</p>
<p>The steady memorandum of the forgetful detective.</p>
<p>But what was written here was not the kind of highly confidential information I was expecting.</p>
<p>&quot;Milk chocolate coffee - 140 yen</p>
<p>Fruit Coke - 130 yen</p>
<p>Butter tea - 150 yen.&quot;</p></div><center><a href="/translation/en/kyouko-balance/002">Previous</a><a href="/translation/en/kyouko-balance/004">Next</a></center></section></div></div><footer class="footer"><section class="container">Â© 2018-2025 Â· Powered by <a href="https://nextjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next.js</a> with the <a href="https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coder</a> theme.</section></footer></main></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"source":"\nOkitegami Kyouko-san.\n\n25 years old.
