{"pageProps":{"source":"\n# About me\n\nI graduated from the [Ensimag](http://ensimag.grenoble-inp.fr/welcome/) (engineering school in applied mathematics and computer science) in 2015.\n\nI then obtained my PhD in applied mathematics in 2018 at the [Jean Kuntzmann Laboratory](https://ljk.imag.fr/index_en.php) in Grenoble, France. I was under the supervision of [Dominique Attali](https://www.gipsa-lab.grenoble-inp.fr/~dominique.attali/), [Quentin MÃ©rigot](http://quentin.mrgt.fr/) and [Boris Thibert](https://www-ljk.imag.fr/membres/Boris.Thibert/) and worked on solving inverse problems arising in optics using methods based on semi-discrete optimal transport and tools from computational geometry (such as Laguerre and Power diagrams). The manuscript can be found [here](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02135220). The figure below illustrates one of the problems I worked on.\n\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/sa2018_banner_smoke_12h_smaller.png\"\n         alt=\"SIGGRAPH 2018 Banner\"\n         width=\"1000px\" />\n    <figcaption>Example of lens design for a collimated light source and a RGB target image (the banner of the SIGGRAPH Asia 2018 conference).</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nI was also a postdoctoral researcher at the [LIRIS](http://liris.cnrs.fr/en) laboratory under the supervision of [Tristan Roussillon](https://perso.liris.cnrs.fr/tristan.roussillon/). I worked on improving plane-probing algorithms for estimating normal vectors on digital planes and digital surfaces.\n\n<figure>\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/torus_normals.png\"\n         alt=\"Estimated normals on a digitization of a torus\"\n         width=\"500px\"\n         style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" />\n    <img src=\"/assets/images/hollow_normals.png\"\n         alt=\"Estimated normals on a digital surface\"\n         width=\"500px\"\n         style=\"vertical-align: middle;\" />\n<figcaption><strong>Left:</strong> estimated normals using a plane-probing algorithm on a digitization of a torus. <strong>Right:</strong> estimated normals on a digital surface.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n\nI was an IT consultant at [Adentis](https://www.adentis.fr/) until September 2023 when I joined [Eaton](https://www.eaton.com/us/en-us.html) as an embedded Linux software engineer.\n\nSome of the programs I have developed can be found on my [GitHub](https://github.com/nyorem) page and my resume can be found in [English](/assets/cv_en.pdf) or in [French](/assets/cv_fr.pdf).\n\nOn a less serious side, I'm quite interested in the Japanese language, click [here](/page/fun) if you want to know more.\n","meta":{"title":"About Me"}},"__N_SSG":true}
